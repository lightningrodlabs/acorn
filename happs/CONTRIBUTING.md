# Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone to the Acorn project. Here are some ways that you can contribute.

## Log an issue

If you download Acorn, and use the software, you might occasionally run into some problems. If and when you do, those issues can be brought up with the Acorn development team, by logging an issue here
in the Github repository for the project. If you have a Github account, or create one, you can do that here: https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn/issues/new

When filing an issue, please include a detailed description of the following: 
- which operating system you were using
- a list of steps you took that led to the issue ("steps to reproduce")
- a screenshot (if not sensitive information)

## Start a discussion

We do not have a separate 'chat' forum for Acorn, apart from the Discussions space on the Github project. Please use it to bring up questions, or to explore potentials.
https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn/discussions
It can also be a good space to connect with other Acorn users, and hear about how they're using Acorn.

## Contribute directly to the software, as a developer

If you are interested to contribute to Acorn's development, welcome! Acorn is written in languages such as Rust and Typescript, and frameworks such as Holochain, and React.
If you have proficiency in either Typescript and React for writing frontend code, or Rust for writing backend code, or both, then you may find it intuitive to contribute.
Generally, new features come through a design -> development pipeline defined by the workflows of the [Sprillow](https://sprillow.com) team, but these workflows could be adapted to more 'open' workflows
if the right opportunity presented itself. Otherwise, contributions may remain more-so in the space of bug fixes and other technical-first features, such as algorithms or scripts.

It should be noted that while the Rust code has unit tests, the frontend code does not. That is another area for potential improvement (front end testing).

In terms of getting the codebase up and running on your local development machine, check out [DEVELOPERS.md](./DEVELOPERS.md).

In terms of getting more familiar with the codebase, you can get a rather in-depth introduction by watching these two videos:
- Acorn technical deep dive, Part 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXrN_H0I0ng
- Acorn technical deep dive, Part 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0VA9QcmoXeI

While some of that code may be out of date, the general introduction should still apply, and be helpful. 

In terms of getting more deeply involved, talking with other contributors, just start by reaching out to connor@sprillow.com to explore what makes sense!

goal
- create: `creator_agent_pub_key` must be the agent committing,
          `user_edit_hash` should be None
- update: `creator_agent_pub_key` should be the same as author of create (meaning must resolve the original_header_address),
          `user_edit_hash` should be Some, and match the agent committing
- delete: allowed by anyone

edge
- create: `parent_action_hash` can't equal `child_action_hash`, no self-referential edges
          `parent_action_hash` and `child_action_hash` depends on the `Goal`s at those addresses
- update: not allowed
- delete: allowed by anyone

entry_point (structurally same as goal_member)
- create: depends on goal at `goal_address` existing,
          `creator_agent_pub_key` must match the agent committing
- update: not allowed
- delete: allowed by anyone

goal_member (structurally same as entry_point)
- create: depends on goal at `goal_address` existing,
          `user_edit_hash` should match the agent committing
          `agent_address` is not validated because the agent is not necessarily in this DNA as a member, could be over in profiles dna
- update: not allowed
- delete: allowed by anyone


goal_comment
- create: depends on goal at `goal_address` existing,
          `agent_address` should match the agent committing
- update: depends on goal at `goal_address` existing,
          `agent_address` should not change from its original value,
          AND only the original author can update
- delete: allowed by anyone (because anyone can delete the goal itself)

goal_vote (same as goal comment)
- create: depends on goal at `goal_address` existing,
          `agent_address` should match the agent committing
- update: depends on goal at `goal_address` existing,
          `agent_address` should not change from its original value,
          AND only the original author can update
- delete: allowed by anyone (because anyone can delete the goal itself)

member
- create: `address` field must match the agent committing
- update: not allowed
- delete: not allowed

project_meta
- create: `creator_agent_pub_key` should match the agent committing,
          only ONE can/should be created
          (can't be 100% certain but don't let one more be
          created if another known exists already. Perform during zome call not validate hook)
- update: anyone can update,
          but only `name` and `image` can change from its original value
- delete: cannot be deleted, for now
